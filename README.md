# Voice Command Processing

![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150?text=Voice+Command)

**Voice Command Processing** is an advanced AI-driven system that combines real-time audio processing, speech-to-text transcription, and natural language processing (NLP) to enable seamless voice command execution. This project empowers users to interact with their devices using voice commands, leveraging cutting-edge audio analysis and AI technologies to process and respond to spoken instructions with high accuracy and efficiency.

Whether you're building a smart assistant, automating tasks, or exploring the intersection of audio processing and NLP, this project provides a robust foundation for voice-driven applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Streams live audio from a microphone and processes it for waveform visualization and spectral analysis.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Converts spoken commands into text using advanced speech recognition models for accurate transcription.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Interprets transcribed text to execute commands or provide context-aware responses using AI-driven language models.
- **Wake Word Detection**: Activates the system with a customizable wake word (default: "nova") for hands-free operation.
- **Contextual Command Execution**: Maintains conversation history and context for coherent and meaningful interactions.
- **Audio Spectrum Visualization**: Displays real-time audio waveforms and frequency spectra for debugging or visualization purposes.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal configuration.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows easy integration of additional features like image processing or external API calls.
- **Rich Terminal Output**: Provides formatted, user-friendly feedback in the terminal for an enhanced user experience.

## How It Works

The Voice Command Processing system operates in three main stages:

1. **Audio Capture and Processing**:
   - Captures live audio input from a microphone using PyAudio.
   - Performs real-time analysis of audio waveforms and frequency spectra using advanced signal processing techniques.
   - Visualizes audio data (optional) for debugging or educational purposes.

2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription**:
   - Utilizes a high-performance speech recognition engine to transcribe spoken words into text.
   - Supports robust transcription even in noisy environments.

3. **Command Interpretation and Execution**:
   - Processes transcribed text using NLP models to understand user intent.
   - Executes commands based on predefined logic or triggers external actions (e.g., API calls, system tasks).
   - Maintains conversation context for multi-turn interactions.

The system is designed to be lightweight yet powerful, making it suitable for applications ranging from personal assistants to IoT device control.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Voice Command Processing system on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A working microphone
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-command-processing.git
   cd voice-command-processing
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For PyAudio specifically, you may need to install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pipwin
   pipwin install pyaudio
   ```

4. **Configure API Keys** (if applicable):
   - If using an external NLP service (e.g., OpenAI), obtain an API key and update the configuration in `config.py` or the main script:
     ```python
     openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-your-api-key")
     ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   Run the main script to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the voice command system by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Activate the Assistant**:
   - Say the wake word ("nova" by default) followed by your command. For example:
     - "Nova, what's the weather like today?"
     - "Nova, play some music."
   - The system will transcribe your speech, process the command, and respond accordingly.

3. **Visualize Audio (Optional)**:
   - To enable real-time audio waveform or spectrum visualization, run:
     ```bash
     python audio_visualizer.py
     ```
   - This will display live audio data using Matplotlib or PyQtGraph.

4. **Customize Commands**:
   - Modify the command logic in `commands.py` to add custom actions or integrate with external services.
   - Update the wake word in `config.py` if desired.

5. **Debugging**:
   - Check the terminal for rich-formatted logs and error messages.
   - Use the `--verbose` flag for detailed output:
     ```bash
     python main.py --verbose
     ```

  ```python
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-api-key"
  ```

  ```python
  SAMPLE_RATE = 44100
  CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
  ```

- **Visualization**: Enable or disable audio visualization:
  ```python
  ENABLE_VISUALIZATION = True
  ```
